brew install applesimutils
```

## Install dependencies

```sh
// Install dependencies
npm install

// Install pods
cd ios && pod install
```
## Start projects

```sh
// Start Metro in new terminal
npx react-native start

// Starting iOS (should launch simulator automatically)
npx react-native run-ios

// Launch Android emulator (note: it is better to use AOSP emulators)
emulator -list-avds

emulator @emulatorNameFromPrevious

// Starting Android
npx react-native run-android
```
